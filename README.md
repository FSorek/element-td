# Essence of Creation
Tower Defense Unity project

##########################################################

This is a game I'm currently working on. Most of the things in this repository are entirely made by me, with a few exceptions that I needed to speed up the process (mainly sounds, a few 3D models and a bunch of 2D images and textures). I'm working on this project alone thus it's somewhat slow development, but I'm motivated to finish this project or have it reach a moment where it's fully playable but might be lacking visual enchancements in some areas.

# About the project
I was inspired by old Warcraft 3 community maps made by different people and because of my love for Tower Defense games I decided to give it a go. Most of stand-alone Tower Defense games offer many different small-sized levels that you beat in order to progress and unlock new towers, upgrades and more, but what stuck to me from the old days of WC3 was how you were given one map (often with many variations in game modes and enviorment themes) and you had to try beating it in a single run and possibly achieving a high score to show off to your friends. The best ones that I've played offered multiple approaches to beating the game with a big variety of unique towers, upgrades and mechanics like randomized waves. I want to have a similar result while not being restricted to a specific game engine in order to enchance all the aspects mentioned above.

# Ideas/Concepts a.k.a. what are the features?

Quick list of the planned main features(more detailed explanation for each point will be added below(WIP)):

  • Over 60 UNIQUE towers with additional upgrade tier ( making it over 120 towers! )
  
  • A very unique way of building your defenses! Featuring merging of the towers instead of just upgrading them!
  
  • Different approach to a life system (win/lose conditions)
  
  • Tower Upgrades
  
  • Artifacts (very impactful upgrades that can change the way something works)
  
  • A slightly complex combat/damage mechanics ( 6 damage types, 4 armor types + shields + boss armor [so 6 total])
  
  • Multiple Game Modes
  
  • Enemies with many different abilities and mechanics
  
  • Many different status effects ( poison, slow, burning etc.)
  
  • More surprises.. :)
  

# What's already done?

  • All tower prefabs ( most of them still need a model )
  
  • Merging and upgrade system
  
  • Tower upgrades researching
  
  • All the damage mechanics
  
  • Planned out whole list of enemies and towers
  
  • Status effects
  
  • Enemy special abilities
  
  • To keep the list shorter -> the game is somewhat playable, meaning I have the basics done
  


# Currently in progress
Main focus: Balancing / Setting up towers and enemies || Tower models, projectiles, particle effects.

Secondary changes: 

  • QoL ( Improve visibility of status effects, re-do/fix UI ) 

  • re-implement the upgrade/research system(currently turned off) 

  • new life system called 'Corruption Points' that adds more depth to the game 
  
  • a tutorial screen ( as soon as balancing and new UI is done )

Late TO-DO list:

  • More enemy models
  
  • Map decorations
  
  • Replacing all placeholders
  
  • Improving the visual side of the game
  
  • Optimisation
  
  • A proper menu with options panel etc.
  

# IMPORTANT NOTES
Attention! The game was going through MAJOR changes in the core mechanics of the game, meaning some areas of it might be causing errors, lacking content or not working at all! I'm trying to keep it to a bare minimum but i cannot guarantee it as I might've missed something. If you notice any errors please mail them to me at okito122@gmail.com with a detailed description of how you casued the error or what you think might have caused it. Any kind of detail will be helpful.
